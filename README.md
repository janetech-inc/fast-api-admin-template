# Fast API Admin Template

A test driven micro-service template to build and deploy a fast API service with Docker and on API Gateway / AWS Lambda.

This template also includes auto admin capabilities for models.

Check out the [live site]().

## Components

- **Python**

  - [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)
  - linting and testing:
    - `pre-commit`
    - `pytest test`

- **Docker** is used to run locally and in the cloud.

  - [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) Dockerfile with multi-architecture support
  - [`docker-compose`](docker-compose.yml) API Gateway and Lambda functions built from docker image

- **API** sample routes are mapped to:
  - `GET /`
  - `GET /resources`
  - `POST /resources`
  - `PUT /resources/{:id}`
  - `DELETE /resources/{:id}`
- - `GET /tasks`
  - `POST /tasks`
  - `PUT /tasks/{:id}`
  - `DELETE /tasks/{:id}`

- **Admin** routes are mapped to:

  - `GET /admin/`
  - `GET /admin/{:resource}`
  - `GET /admin/{:resource}/{:id}`

- **Serverless** API Gateway and functions mapped to lambda-web on cloud (HttpServer locally).

  - [`serverless.yml`](serverless.yml)

- **Deployment** Actions to deploy on branch commits

  - [.github/workflows](.github/workflows/development.yml) Github actions
    - lint [```feature```]
    - test [```feature```]
    - deploy [```main```, ```production```]
    - tag [```production```]

- **Views** Bootstrap 5 views based of the following templates
  - [templates](.github/workflows/development.yml) Github actions

## Requirements

- [`FastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/)
- [`Node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [`AWS CLI`](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

## Creating a new service

Create a new service by selecting the button above :point_down:

<img src="static/assets/images/use-template.png" width="150">

> To setup your local environment:

    python -m venv venv
    . ./venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Development

> While working on a feature to start the service locally run:

      python apps/main.py

> Or use docker

      docker-compose up
      docker-compose up --build

> Before you are ready to merge your feature, to test running lambda, you can run:

      serverless offline

### Adding a new route

> For CRUD applications, follow the example in [resource.rs](apps/api.routes/resource.rs) and add your resource route to:

      apps/api/routes

> For example if you are building an API to manage Users and Shares, you would create:

      apps/api/routes/users.rs
      apps/api/routes/shares.rs

### Adding a new model

> For admin enabled views, inherit from `BaseAdmin`. Follow the example [resource.rs](apps/api/models/resource.rs) add your models:

      apps/api/models/users.rs
      apps/api/models/shares.rs

### Connecting to a source DB

TODO: Add DB support

### Adding views

Follow the example [resource/dashboard.html](templates/resource/dashboard.html) for a custom model view:

## Test Driven Development

Before writing any functionality, we recommend you write your tests first. See the examples in:

- [unit](tests/unit.rs)
- [integration](tests/integration.rs)

To add tests, simply add to the appropriate package and using [automod]() it will be automatically detected to run.

> To run tests

      pytest test

> To run specific tests

      pytest test --package <package-name>

\*\* When using actix-web modules, it is not recommended (or easy) to unit test a route module. Follow the example in [tests/integration/routes/resource.rs](tests/integration/routes/resource_test.rs) to add an route integration test.

<br/>

## Deploying

`aws configure` has been run.

> To deploy locally:

    npm install
    serverless deploy

<br/>

## Continuous Integration

<!-- Is this correct grammar or there's some mistake? -->

Github workflows are will trigger of off specific branches

- [feature.yml](.github/workflows/feature.yml): Lint and test worflows will run any time there is a push to any feature branch.
- [development.yml](.github/workflows/development.yml): Lint, test and deployment worflows will run any time there is a push to **main** branch.
- [production.yml](.github/workflows/production.yml): Lint, test, deployment and release worflows will run any time there is a push to **main** branch.

This project uses Github workflows.

You will need to configure a role in AWS for the github service to use. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/aws-assume-role-github-actions).

### Permissions

You may need to add more permissions to your role. Be as restrictive as possible when adding more permissions
